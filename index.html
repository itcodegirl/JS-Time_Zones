    <h1>JavaScript Time Zones</h1>

    <p>
      JavaScript provides a variety of ways to work with time zones, though by
      default, the Date object is limited to handling the local time zone of the
      environment in which it's executed. Here is a detailed explanation of how
      JavaScript handles time zones, along with some methods and libraries that
      help manage them.
    </p>

    <h2>1. JavaScript Date Object</h2>
    <p>
      The JavaScript Date object handles dates and times, but it is limited in
      its ability to work directly with time zones. By default, the Date object
      works with the local time zone of the user's environment.
    </p>
    <h3>Key Points:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local Time: `Date`</strong> objects use the local time of the
        system where the code is running.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>UTC:</strong> JavaScript can work with UTC (Coordinated
        Universal Time) using methods like
        <strong>`.getUTCDate()`, `.getUTCHours()`</strong>, etc.
      </li>
