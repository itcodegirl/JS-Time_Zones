    <h1>JavaScript Time Zones</h1>

    <p>
      JavaScript provides a variety of ways to work with time zones, though by
      default, the Date object is limited to handling the local time zone of the
      environment in which it's executed. Here is a detailed explanation of how
      JavaScript handles time zones, along with some methods and libraries that
      help manage them.
    </p>

    <h2>1. JavaScript Date Object</h2>
    <p>
      The JavaScript <strong class="baby-blue">`Date`</strong> object handles
      dates and times, but it is limited in its ability to work directly with
      time zones. By default, the
      <strong class="baby-blue">`Date</strong> object works with the local time
      zone of the user's environment.
    </p>
    <h3>Key Points:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong class="baby-blue">Local Time: `Date`</strong> objects use the
        local time of the system where the code is running.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="baby-blue">UTC:</strong> JavaScript can work with UTC
        (Coordinated Universal Time) using methods like
        <strong class="baby-blue">`.getUTCDate()`, `.getUTCHours()`</strong>,
        etc.
      </li>
      <br />

      <h2>2. Working with Time Zones</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript does not have built-in support for time zones other than the
        local time zone and UTC. To work with different time zones, you
        typically need to use a library such as
        <strong class="baby-blue">`moment-timezone`</strong> or the newer
        <strong class="baby-blue"> Intl.DateTimeFormat </strong> API.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong class="baby-blue">Using Intl.DateTimeFormat</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        The <strong class="baby-blue">`Intl.DateTimeFormat`</strong> object can
        format dates according to different locales and time zones.
      </p>
